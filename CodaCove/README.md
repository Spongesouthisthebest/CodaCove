**About**
- CodeCove is an online learning app where coding courses are available, some for free and some are paid.

**Tech Stack**
- MERN Stack - MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js

**Idea**
- 1) User signs up,
- 2) User logs in
- 3) A page with many courses show up.
- 4) Student can either buy a course or use a free one.
- 5) If the student wants to become a teacher, they would have a button on top saying: "Continue as a teacher"
- 6) If the student wants to learn through a course, they would click it and a menu would show up with the course info posted by the teacher. 100% of the profit earned by the course would be given to the teacher. 
- 7) To publish a course we would make a simple form which would have a Description, Duration, Teacher's name, Title (general info). Apart from that it would also have the course content like a big box where the teacher writes notes, and also a video explanation. 
- 8) At first all courses would be free. 
- 9) After writing the general info, the teacher would be redirected to the contents page and after that the teacher would be redirected to the payments page where the teacher would put in their payment info (on which they would receive their payments). 
- 10) The teacher would be redirected to the billing info page of their course. 
- 11) The teacher would be filling in the course's price (it has to be above $5)
- 12) Finally the teacher would publish the course. 
- 13) As of now the teacher wont be redirected to the payments page, the integration of payments would be done once there are enough users on the platform.
